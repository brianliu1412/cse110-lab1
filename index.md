# Hi, I'm Brian Liu
## Professional
I'm a third year **Math-CS** Major and **Design** Minor. I enjoy working on `front-end development` on my free time! Outside of school, I've had half a year's worth of professional experience as a Software Engineering Intern. <br>

During my internship, I learned how to center a div. /s 
``` 
display: flex;
align-items: center;
justify-content: center;
```
